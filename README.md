# Course Schedule Planner

This is a semester-long individual project for Enterprise Java Programming course that aims to showcase experience with Java, Java Web Development, Unit Testing, Database Design, and Hibernate Object Relational Mapping.

## Problem Statement

When it comes to scheduling, I believe that an image is worth a thousand words. My goal is to create a web application that would greatly simplify course scheduling. The user simply chooses the courses they would like to enroll into, the application loads the information about all the available class meeting times for these courses, and generates a visual representations for all the possible schedules. Instead of piecing together a dozen of "TuTh 10:30am-12:00pm" and "MW 2:00pm-4:00pm" the user just goes through the schedules one by one and chooses the one they like.
